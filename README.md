This programm was the practice part of a project paper in computer science.
It uses SFML to send and recieve Audiomessages via TCP.
If you find any bugs i would appreciate an e-mail describing it.
By no means is this project polished, have a look at the bugs.md to get an overview about what is still to do.
To run this Programm you need the libelsuit.ttf in the execution directory. (or you change the Font in the code to a font of your choice)
